                >During my academic journey, I participated in several coding
                competitions and hackathons, which enhanced my problem-solving
                skills. Additionally, I took specialized courses in web & app
                development, and artificial intelligence, which allowed me to
                apply my knowledge to real-world projects. This academic
                background has equipped me with the technical expertise and
                analytical mindset required for a successful career in software
                engineering.</strong

                I have 1 years of hands-on experience in frontend development,
                primarily working with web & app development technologies such
                as HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.
                During this time, I have contributed to several Assignments,
